this is my first project in C 

it's a simple TextEditor(not yet)

but i well improve it later
when you compile texitor and type whit this it save charactors in buffer that is 2D array thes when you press CTRL+S
it create a .txt file . . .. 

i know its so simple but i see this as a start point and other thing i well write whith C well be better an more complex...
