this is my first project in C 

it's a simple TextEditor(not yet)

but i well improve it later
when you compile texitor and type whit this it save charactors in buffer which is 2D array then when you press CTRL+S
it create a txt file  and save what you type in it. . .. 

i know it's so simple but i see this as a start point and other thing i well write whith C well be better an more complex...
